# Validation Library Development Task

## Task:

Develop a robust validation library in JavaScript to validate complex data structures. The implementation should leverage optimisation, documentation, and testing. Align with modern ECMAScript (ES6+) standards, enhance maintainability, improve performance, and establish a more robust architecture.

## Requirements:

### Implement Core Validator Functions

- Design type-safe validator functions for primitive types: string, number, boolean.
- Extend validation to support complex types, including arrays and objects.
- Ensure validators adhere to best practices of JavaScript's type system.

### Documentation & Refactoring

- Generate inline documentation and examples.
- Refactor code to improve clarity, maintainability, and consistency.
- Guide on how to run your application and use your library(README.md)

### Comprehensive Test Coverage:

- Implement comprehensive unit tests using Jest testing framework
- Implement test cases for both valid and invalid data scenarios.
- Expand test suite for maximum validation robustness.
- Generate a test coverage report (test_report.txt) from Jest

### Enhancements:

- Suggest improvements to enhance efficiency and scalability.
- Generate structured reports highlighting edge cases and validation reliability.
- Provide actionable feedback to refine validation logic and performance.

### Additionals:

- Maintain modular architecture to support future extensibility.
- Ensure performance optimization to handle large-scale data validation efficiently.
- Follow industry standards for data integrity and security.
- Save prompt in prompt.md
