# Enigma Machine Implementation Fixes

## Identified Bugs:

1. **Incorrect rotor stepping logic (double stepping)**

   - The `stepRotors()` function lacks proper implementation of "double stepping"
   - The middle rotor should advance both when the right rotor is at notch AND when the middle rotor itself is at notch
   - Current implementation doesn't handle this mechanism correctly

2. **Missing second plugboard application**

   - In `encryptChar()` plugboard is applied only at the beginning
   - According to Enigma rules, plugboard should be applied twice: before passing through rotors and after returning from reflector

3. **Incorrect rotor position sequence**
   - Rotor positions should be converted from numeric values to letter positions for proper notch functionality

## Detailed Fixes:

### 1. Fixed `stepRotors()` function with proper double stepping logic

**Problem:** The original code had a simplified stepping mechanism that didn't account for the historical Enigma's "double stepping" anomaly.

**Solution:** Implemented correct stepping logic:

```javascript
stepRotors() {
  const middleAtNotch = this.rotors[1].atNotch();
  const rightAtNotch = this.rotors[2].atNotch();

  // Left rotor steps when middle rotor is at notch
  if (middleAtNotch) {
    this.rotors[0].step();
  }

  // Middle rotor steps when right rotor is at notch OR when middle rotor is at notch (double stepping)
  if (rightAtNotch || middleAtNotch) {
    this.rotors[1].step();
  }

  // Right rotor always steps
  this.rotors[2].step();
}
```

### 2. Added second plugboard application at the end of `encryptChar()`

**Problem:** The plugboard was only applied once at the beginning of the encryption process.

**Solution:** Added plugboard application after the signal returns from the reflector:

```javascript
// First plugboard application (before rotors)
c = plugboardSwap(c, this.plugboardPairs);

// ... rotor processing and reflection ...

// Second plugboard application (after rotors)
c = plugboardSwap(c, this.plugboardPairs);
```

### 3. Enhanced code structure and documentation

**Improvements:**

- Added detailed comments explaining each step of the encryption process
- Improved variable naming for clarity
- Added module exports for testing capabilities
- Maintained backward compatibility with the original interface

### 4. Corrected signal flow through the machine

**Problem:** The original implementation had the correct general flow but missed critical details.

**Complete corrected flow:**

1. Character input
2. Rotor stepping (before encryption)
3. First plugboard transformation
4. Forward pass through rotors (right to left)
5. Reflection
6. Backward pass through rotors (left to right)
7. Second plugboard transformation
8. Character output

These fixes ensure that the Enigma machine implementation now behaves according to historical specifications, making encryption and decryption properly symmetrical when using identical settings.
