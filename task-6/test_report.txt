  * Impact: Low - UI code doesn't affect cryptographic functionality
  
- Lines 128-130: Module execution check
  * Reason: Entry point detection, not core functionality
  * Impact: None - administrative code

- Lines 148-152: Module exports
  * Reason: Module system code, tested implicitly

significantly exceeds the 60% requirement and focuses on the most important
aspects of the code.

All identified bugs from the original implementation have corresponding tests
to prevent regression, ensuring the historical accuracy of the Enigma machine
simulation.
