# Task: Sea Battle Game Refactoring

## Objective
Refactor the existing JavaScript codebase (seabattle.js) to align with modern ECMAScript (ES6+) standards, enhance maintainability, improve performance, and establish a more robust architecture without altering core gameplay mechanics.

## Tasks & Requirements

### 1. Codebase Analysis
- Review the existing implementation to identify inefficiencies, outdated patterns, and areas requiring structural improvements
- Document key observations regarding current functionality and code quality

### 2. ECMAScript Modernization
Upgrade syntax to ES6+ standards, utilizing:
- Classes for game components
- Modules for better separation of logic
- let/const instead of var for variable declarations
- Arrow functions for concise callbacks
- Promises & async/await to enhance asynchronous logic

### 3. Code Structure & Architectural Improvements
- Implement clear separation of concerns, ensuring distinct modules for:
  - Game logic (e.g., ship placement, attack processing)
  - User interface rendering (DOM manipulation & interactions)
  - Utility/helper functions (e.g., randomization, validation)
- Reduce global variable usage by properly encapsulating state within classes or modules
- Adopt an appropriate architectural pattern like MVC, or modular components for better maintainability

### 4. Readability & Maintainability Enhancements
- Apply consistent code styling and enforce clear naming conventions for variables and functions
- Refactor complex logic into smaller, reusable functions for better readability
- Improve documentation with inline comments and function descriptions

### 5. Preserve Core Gameplay Mechanics
Ensure that core game logic remains unchanged:
- 10x10 grid system for board layout
- Turn-based coordinate input (e.g., 00, 34)
- Standard Battleship mechanicsâ€”hit, miss, sunk detection
- Existing CPU opponent logic, including 'hunt' and 'target' modes for strategic AI behavior

### 6. Documentation & Summary
- Clearly document changes made, the rationale behind refactoring decisions, and improvements achieved
- Create a refactoring.md file summarizing updates and enhancements

### 7. Unit Testing Implementation
- Implement comprehensive unit tests using Jest testing framework
- Tests should verify core game logic and critical functionalities:
  - Utility functions (coordinate validation, parsing, randomization)
  - Ship class (placement, hit detection, sinking logic)
  - Board class (ship placement, shot processing, game state)
  - AI Player class (move generation, targeting logic)
  - Game logic integration
- Ensure test coverage is at least 60% across core modules
- Generate a test coverage report (test_report.txt) from Jest
- Include test scripts in package.json for easy execution
