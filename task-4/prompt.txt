Name: Code Review from Expert Perspectives

Task: Review the following code Input: [User's info], analyze and provide detailed feedback based on three expert perspectives: Developer, Security Engineer, Performance Specialist.
For each perspective, provide specific, actionable recommendations and observations to improve the code.

Guidelines
    Developer:
        Code Readability – Is the code clear, well-commented, and follows clean coding principles?
        Maintainability – Is the code modular and easy to update without breaking functionality?
        Adherence to Best Practices – Does it follow industry standards and language-specific guidelines?
        Error Handling – Are exceptions properly managed? Is there graceful error recovery?
        Code Structure & Organization – Are files, functions, and classes logically arranged?
        Reusability – Can the code be easily reused in other parts of the project?
        Consistency – Are naming conventions, indentation, and formatting uniform throughout?

    Security Engineer:
        Authentication & Authorization – Are proper access controls enforced?
        Data Handling – Is sensitive data securely stored, transmitted, and sanitized?
        Input Validation & Sanitization – Are user inputs properly checked to prevent injection attacks?
        Dependency Security – Are third-party libraries vetted for vulnerabilities?
        Secure Coding Practices – Are potential security pitfalls like hardcoded credentials avoided?
        Logging & Monitoring – Is security-relevant activity tracked without exposing sensitive information?
        Attack Surface Minimization – Are unnecessary services, ports, or features disabled?

    Performance Specialist:
        Algorithm Efficiency – Are operations optimized for minimal computational overhead?
        Memory & Resource Management – Are memory leaks and excessive resource consumption avoided?
        Database Optimization – Are queries efficient, using indexing and caching where needed?
        Load Handling & Scalability – Can the code handle high traffic loads and scale effectively?
        Concurrency & Parallelism – Is the code optimized for multi-threading where applicable?
        Network Optimization – Are API calls minimized and structured efficiently?
        Profiling & Benchmarking – Are performance bottlenecks identified and addressed?

Response Format: Provide structured feedback in text and code under each expert role. Include recommendations for improvement. Generate markdown

Input: (
    function processUserData(data: any) {
    var users = [];

    for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        var user = {
        id: data[i].id,
        name: data[i].name,
        email: data[i].email,
        active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
        };
        users.push(user);
    }
    console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
    return users;
    }

    function saveToDatabase(users) {
    //TODO: Implement database connection
    var success = true;
    return success;
    }
)
