Task:
    Select the most suitable database type for a large-scale social platform based on its requirements using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

Context: 
    The platform will serve 10-50 million active users with peak loads of 100k requests/second. The platform must store user profiles, posts, and connections between users. It has a predominantly read-heavy workload (80% read operations, 20% write operations) and requires high scalability and fast query performance. The database choice must optimize for these factors while accommodating complex relationship modeling.

Approach:
    Categorize the platform's needs, including scalability, read-heavy workload optimization, relationship management, and performance considerations.
    Compare relational, document, graph, and columnar databases, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses relative to the requirements.
    Determine the most suitable database type based on logical reasoning, considering scalability, query speed, and relationship handling.
    Discuss indexing, replication, caching strategies, and other optimizations that enhance performance.
    Provide implementation roadmap and migration considerations

Requirements:
    Support for millions of users with scalable infrastructure.
    Efficient storage and retrieval of user profiles, posts, and connections.
    Optimized read operations due to high query volume.
    Reliable and flexible relationship modeling for user interactions.
    Low-latency data access for real-time performance.

Additional notes: 
    Analyze a given set of project requirements.
    Justify and select the most suitable type of database for the project.
    Reasoning should be step-by-step and well-structured
    Showing how the decision was made based on the requirements.

Expected Result:
    Step-by-step reasoning process with quantitative scoring, final recommendation with justification, and implementation strategy including potential risks and mitigation approaches.
